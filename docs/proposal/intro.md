# Product Image Management Automation for PDPs

---

## Executive Summary

The current manual process of managing product images for Product Detail Pages (PDPs) across Bynder, Lucid Link, and Salsify is inefficient, error-prone, and inconsistent in quality. This proposal outlines an automated solution leveraging API integrations and Cloudinaryâ€™s powerful image transformation and delivery features to streamline the ingestion, processing, and delivery of product images. The solution aims to reduce manual effort, ensure consistent high-quality images, and provide scalability for growing product catalogs.

---

## Understanding the Current Problem

- **Manual exports** from multiple source systems cause delays and inconsistencies.
- **Manual resizing and optimization** are time-consuming and vary in quality.
- **Manual upload** to Cloudinary introduces risk of human error.
- **Manual linking** of image URLs to PDPs delays product launches.
- Lack of automation **limits scalability** and **auditability**.

---

## Proposed Solution

Automate the product image pipeline using a centralized service that:

1. **Fetches images via APIs** from Bynder, Lucid Link, and Salsify.
2. **Uploads images directly to Cloudinary**.
3. Uses **Cloudinary transformations** for resizing, optimization, and formatting (e.g., WebP, adaptive quality).
4. Stores **metadata and status in a tracking system** (database or dashboard).
5. Exposes an API or webhook for PDP to fetch image URLs dynamically or updates PDP CMS automatically.
6. Supports **incremental syncs** to handle new or updated images efficiently.

## Detailed Workflow Description

1. **Triggering the Process**: Scheduled jobs (e.g., daily) or event-driven triggers initiate the ingestion service.

2. **Fetching Images**: The service calls APIs for Bynder, Lucid Link, and Salsify to list and retrieve new or updated images.

3. **Image Upload & Transformation**:
   - Images are uploaded programmatically to Cloudinary.
   - During upload, Cloudinary transformations are applied: resizing (e.g., 500x400), format conversion (WebP), quality optimization, and cropping.
   - Use Cloudinary folders or tags to organize images by product or source.

4. **Metadata & Audit Logging**:
   - The ingestion service records metadata, upload status, timestamps, and any errors in a tracking database.
   - This enables monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting.

5. **Image Delivery**:
   - Cloudinary URLs with transformation parameters are exposed via an API or injected dynamically into the PDP/CMS.
   - PDPs load images optimized for device and bandwidth automatically.

6. **Incremental Updates**:
   - The system detects new or updated images only, avoiding redundant uploads.
   - Supports manual re-sync for corrections.

## Key Cloudinary Capabilities Utilized

- **Upload API with transformations**: resize, crop, format conversion (e.g., to WebP), quality optimization.
- **Folders and tagging**: organize images for easier management.
- **CDN delivery**: fast, global image serving.
- **Dynamic URL generation**: serve images adapted to device and viewport.
- **Webhooks** (optional): notify the system or trigger workflows on upload events.

---

## Key Design Considerations

- **API Rate Limits**: Handle API rate limits gracefully with retries and batching.
- **Error Handling & Retry Logic**: Robust error handling for network/API failures.
- **Security**: Secure storage of API keys and tokens; secure communication with Cloudinary and source systems.
- **Scalability**: Design for high-volume image processing with horizontal scaling.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new source systems or modify transformation rules.
- **Audit & Monitoring**: Track progress, success, failures, and image metadata.

## Potential Challenges

- **API Changes**: Source system APIs might change, requiring maintenance.
- **Rate Limits and Quotas**: Need to handle and respect API usage limits.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring metadata matches images correctly, especially with incremental updates.
- **Error Recovery**: Handling partial failures without losing data or blocking pipelines.
- **Latency**: Large image batches might increase processing time; consider parallelism and throttling.
- **Access Control**: Proper permissions to fetch images from all source systems.
- Stagger each image source job and not put them in one job in case one fetch fails.
